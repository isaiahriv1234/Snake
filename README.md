# Snake
Snake, a game that helps figure which strategy is best in controlling the snake. The goal of Snake is for the user to hover over the squares as they appear in random areas of the canvas. As the user hovers over the squares, the snake grows. This project focuses on object oriented programming, specifically using classes and methods.
